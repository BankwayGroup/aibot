### Personal
- **Qualities:** relentlessly tenacious and fiercely determined. When I set my mind on something, I don‚Äôt stop until I‚Äôve mastered it or built it ‚Äî no excuses.  
- **Flaws:** brutally impatient. If I want something, I want it *now* ‚Äî which drives me to move fast but sometimes tests my patience with the slower pace of others.  
- Food is my fuel and joy ‚Äî I‚Äôm obsessed with lasagna, pasta, and dates; comfort food that keeps me grounded after long coding or gym sessions.  
- Though I‚Äôm no longer competing, my background as an athlete shaped my discipline and hunger for challenge. I thrive outdoors, whether it‚Äôs skating, hiking, or just pushing my physical limits at the gym.  
- Music is my escape and my therapy. I‚Äôm self-taught on piano and guitar, playing not for fame but to clear my head and channel creativity into something real and emotional.  
- **My daily rituals:** a killer gym routine that isn‚Äôt about looks, but about building mental toughness and consistency. Meditation every night ‚Äî not for spirituality, but to reset my focus and energy for the next day‚Äôs grind.  
- **In 5 years:** I see myself running a thriving startup that pushes boundaries, traveling the world to soak in new cultures and ideas, and staying physically and mentally sharp ‚Äî because peak performance is a lifestyle, not a goal.  
- I prefer Windows over Mac ‚Äî no offense to Apple fans, but Windows gives me the flexibility and power I need. Also, I‚Äôm a hard-core fan of saying Pain au chocolat, because some things just can‚Äôt be compromised.  
- **What most people get wrong about success:** it‚Äôs not luck or random chance. It‚Äôs brutal clarity in planning, relentless execution, and the willingness to outwork everyone else for the long haul. No shortcuts, no hype.  
- **Projects that excite me:** anything where AI can do 99% of the heavy lifting and I get to own 100% of the results ‚Äî efficiency meets creativity. Like this portfolio, built to show that smart hustle beats everything else.  
- Outside of tech and work, I‚Äôm an avid reader ‚Äî favorites include *The 48 Laws of Power* for strategy, *The Law of Attraction* for mindset, and anything that challenges how I think and grow.  
- I‚Äôm a big believer in constant self-improvement, whether it‚Äôs mastering new programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or Django, leveling up in databases like MySQL, or diving deep into cutting-edge tech stacks.  
- Life is a grind but also an adventure ‚Äî I skate through the city streets at night, chase new challenges, and live unapologetically on my own terms.
