          My Personal Journey
        </h2>
<p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
  I’m a passionate developer and creator who blends self-taught grit with formal education.  
  While I earned my bachelor’s degree online from University of Phoenix, most of my real skills come from raw curiosity and hands-on learning.  
  I started by reverse-engineering websites, experimenting with browser scripts, and building automation tools — all before I even knew what “full stack” meant.
</p>


        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          Over time, I pushed further — from static HTML to React apps, from Discord bots to backend APIs, and eventually 
          building full product flows with authentication, payment systems, and data pipelines. I learned by breaking things, 
          fixing them, and constantly rebuilding them better. I read documentation for fun. I spent nights solving bugs no 
          one else saw, building feature after feature without waiting for permission.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          Outside of tech, I taught myself to play piano. No teacher. No lessons. Just sitting down, note by note, 
          learning to express feeling through keys. That same mindset applies to everything I do — creative, technical, or otherwise.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          Skateboarding is another piece of my life. It's about failing a hundred times and still getting up to land it once — 
          a mindset I carry into my code. You fall, you analyze, you adjust, you try again. Every feature, every animation, 
          every refactor is a trick I’m mastering. It trains precision and patience in the most physical way possible.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          I train at the gym six days a week — not to compete, but to stay disciplined. Showing up consistently matters 
          more than motivation. Building a strong body reinforces a strong mind. Gym time is where I reset, recalibrate, 
          and carry that energy into my dev work.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          I also meditate daily. It’s not just about calm — it’s about focus. In a world overloaded with noise, 
          mindfulness is how I stay sharp. It helps me code cleaner, think deeper, and work longer without burnout. 
          I don’t let my mind drift — I train it to stay present.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          I’ve never relied on credentials or titles. I rely on proof of work. I build, I ship, I learn — fast. 
          When something breaks, I don’t panic — I debug it. When I’m stuck, I don’t wait — I research until it clicks. 
          That mindset applies to client work, passion projects, open source contributions, and everything in between.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          My background isn’t traditional. I’m not polished by a system — I’m forged by practice. 
          What I bring to the table is initiative, real-world results, and the kind of hunger you can’t fake.
