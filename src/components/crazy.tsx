          My Real Journey
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          I never climbed mountains or competed in sports — but my journey has been every bit as intense.
          I’m a self-taught full-stack developer, pianist, skater, gym rat, and deep thinker. No mentors. 
          No shortcuts. Just late nights, broken code, sore hands, and an obsession with getting better.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          I taught myself how to code from scratch — reading docs, reverse-engineering websites, debugging at 3AM with nothing but a stubborn will to figure it out.
          I never had a teacher, just a burning curiosity and the guts to fail forward.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          When I wasn’t writing code, I was skating through empty parking garages or dead streets at midnight — headphones in, world off. 
          Skating taught me flow, pain tolerance, and how to get up after every fall.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          I also taught myself piano — no formal lessons, no music theory background, just intuition and repetition.
          I play to clear my head, to connect with emotion, and to create something beautiful from silence.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          Every morning starts with the gym — not for looks, but for discipline. For the mindset. For knowing that no matter how chaotic the world gets,
          I’ve already overcome resistance before the day even begins.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          I meditate every night. Not in some spiritual way — just enough to reset, recenter, and remind myself why I’m doing all this.
          Stillness is part of the grind too.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
          I live by one rule: if I don’t know it, I learn it. If it breaks, I fix it. If no one else is doing it, I do it my way.
          This isn’t just what I do — it’s who I am.
        </p>
